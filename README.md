[@abdominal8](https://www.reddit.com/user/abdominal8/), please reach out if you reappear, I am happy to hand over this repo & you can use GitHub Pages to host your original site without needing to manage a domain, hosting & certs.

This project's goal is to revive and evolve the project originally hosted on [watchqc.com](https://watchqc.com) (Can be accessed at [https://web.archive.org/web/20230518035653/https://watchqc.com/](https://web.archive.org/web/20230518035653/https://watchqc.com/))
Unfortunately, the creator's account was suspended on Reddit and never resurfaced again after the site went down. [The original creator also wanted to publish the code on GitHub.](https://www.reddit.com/r/RepTime/comments/zxasgc/comment/j23hi2j/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) In light of these, I treat the original project as abandonware at the moment.

## Initial state and changes
The website originally is a static website using JS to slightly manipulate uploaded pictures to carry out software-assisted QC of watches. The initial goal was to replicate the original site's functionalities as closely as possible.

I went through the code to ensure that everything happened on the client side and that there were no tracking links present.

The changes I made were the following:
* Removed [archive.org](https://archive.org) rewrites
* Removed Google tracking links
* Removed the Ad at site load as it was just a static picture & did not contribute any affiliate commissions to the original creator
* Added a small banner for the creator
* Rearranged project files in subfolders

## Changes based on user requests
* Smoother rotate with the mouse
* Rotate image with arrow keys
* Pitch to zoom on mobile
* Resolution issues when downloading image
* Move rotate icon from the middle
* Smoother Android touch move
* Images now are loading to fit on the longer side
* Rewritten minified JS code for better readability
* Deferred JS scripts
* Upgraded libraries
